QUEST's five-course curriculum focuses on experiential learning through multidisciplinary, team-based, and hands-on projects. In the programâ€™s capstone course, companies engage teams of QUEST students with real organizational challenges and dedicate resources to help students address these problems. Student teams must enhance their skills in quality management, process improvement, and systems design and will apply these to add value to a client. The purpose of this page is to highlight the quantifiable impact students have made through their recommendations.</p>
